<h1>Echo Transit</h1>
<p>
	Passenger transport spacetime tracking.
</p>
<h3>
	Motivation
</h3>
<p>
	Private automobiles overtook public transit because they offered a better UX.
	In 1888, Bertha Benz captured the world's imagination when she took the first roadtrip with her two sons.
	After the first war, Henry Ford made them accessible and affordable.
	After the second, Alfred Sloan, father of planned obsolescence, and his gaggle of <a href="http://wikipedia.org/en/Great_Streetcar_Conspiracy">convicted conspirators</a> swept away the street rails.
	By the end of the 20th century, America had become a parking lot.
</p>
<p>
	Now this millennial generation is shedding the yoke of the motor wagons.
	Humanless carriages are a <a href="google-driverless-cars">reality</a>.
	"<a href="http://uber.com">Ride</a> <a href="http://lyft.com">sharing</a>" is all the rage.
	Rail ridership is <a href="amtrak-passenger-stats">resurging</a>.
	Horse-drawn buggies are <a href="horses-return-to-vegas">returning</a>.
	And wealth is pouring back into downtowns.
	The kids don't wanna spin the wheels of their gas guzzlah like their boomer grandpop,
	living out in a suburban desert.
	Why spend 9 kilodollars a year for an isolation pod, a road rage inducer.
	<a href="">X's '1x interview with Marc Andreessen</a> reminded me of <a href="">Playboy talking with Steve Jobs in '84</a>.
	This "sharing economy" might mean more "unloading tiresome burdens".
	Automobiles, <a href="">the greatest killer of young people in the U.S.</a>, have become more crippling than liberating; a hassel, a bore -- Dead Ends and Do Not Enters and traffic cops.
	<a href="">Tire malls and... (Roger Rabbit.)</a>
	A smartphone means <a href="trail-off-brighton-ave-in-old-portland">taking that trail</a> in the night,
	because the flashlight illuminates the path and GPS maps show the way.
	Speaking strictly from experience,
	and as a child born during the reign of Reagan at that,
	smartphones now shine a brighter beacon of freedom (if you really embrace them).
<p>
	From Massachusetts to California, freeways are being replaced with greenways and walkways.
	In San Francisco, our millennial city of seven hills, the <a href="http://wikipedia.org/en/PCC_streetcars">PCC streetcars</a> feel contemporary, the busses outdated, the cable cars futuristic.
	Perhaps <a href="timewave-zero">2012</a> was the curve point of the track of history;
	we're ahead of, but alongside, our evolution --
	able to decide our culture instead of accepting it unconsciously.
	The fish don't realize they're in water, but the dolphins -- once deerlike creatures -- certainly do.
	We're climbing back into passenger transport, like the cephalopods to the sea,
	and <strong>Echo Transit</strong> looks to seize the opportunity to improve the experience,
	to make riding the tram or bus easier, faster, and more fun than hailing,
	whether by hand or screen,
	a cab (or proprietary-ride-share).

	Content
</h3>
<p>
	The initial map and schedule are for the bus route between Bangor to Old Town, Maine,
	which closely follows the first passenger rail line in the U.S. 
	In 1835... TODO
</p>
<p>
	In 1914, one could ride an electric street railcar from Bangor to Old Town after midnight.
	Today the bus doesn't run past 19:00.
</p>
<p>
	As well as being the first passenger transport line,
	the area is also home to the Penobscot Nation,
	who claim the oldest continuing government in the world.
</p>
<h3>
	Process
</h3>
<p>
	Currently a static mockup in HTML and CSS only.
	This is to focus on getting the design right before adding any code,
	but also building with the actual materials (instead of, say, Adobe products).
	A scale model, if you will, as opposed to blueprints.
</p>
<p>
	Earlier attempts consisted of templates and DOM assembly and quickly veered off course,
	as implementation concerns ground the design process to a halt.
	Technical debt amassed, as if racking up a list of renovations while laying the foundation.
	Creating software seems more akin to producing a teleseries or image strip than a building:
	thus this approach fits in line with first writing the teleplay, doing the pencils.
	This is the script, the pencil drawing, to be acted out and recorded, inked and colored.
</p>
<p>
	More accurately, software resembles a lifeform.
	We are, after all, made of code.
	We're more operating system than computer.
	(But our codebase is smaller.)
	To grow a mammal, you can't put up the bones, then fill in the meat, and finally slap some skin over it all.
	With life, breaking the build deletes the instance (and that's where copies of the repo are kept).
</p>
<p>
	This is static for now, because it's still in fetal form.
</p>
<p>
	The idea is to get the route interface right first.
	Comparatively little attention has been given to the means of selecting routes,
	and virtually none to country,
	subdivision (i.e. state/province/territory),
	or subsubdivision (i.e. county/parrish/municipality).
</p>
<p>
	I went to college at the University of Maine, and after moving off campus to Old Town,
	took the bus often.
	One time, in December, right before the holiday break, I missed the bus,
	and walked the hour across the island to campus, to catch a bus to Bangor and on to southern Maine.
	I declared I needed an automobile, and my parents helped me out.
	It was a mistake.
	A year later I hit a patch of ice and spun out into the grass median of 295, outside Old Portland.
	In many universes, I died there; in this one, I, and my car, was unharmed.
	I had a tough time driving after that.
	I sold it in the spring of '14, and took the "Community Connector" all summer,
	before moving from the Penobscot to the Presumpscot when the air started cooling.
</p>
<p>
	The Community Connector used to be known as the "BAT" &ndash;
	Bangor Area Transportation (officially I don't think it stood for anything though).
	"Community Connector" has nice sentiment, but makes for a boring mouthful.
	Transit services need a snippy name, and the bat also fit the area perfectly.
	(Stephen King captured the feeling of the place;
	riding down Route 2,
	past an auto yard and <a href="">lubrication shack</a> (now demolished) and Mt. Hope Cemetary and Flagg's,
	and you see where he got it.)
	I considered trying to start a project to stick microcontrollers on the busses,
	and "Echo" seemed an appropriate name.
	I'm not really sure where this will go,
	but when revisiting the project here as the snow begins to fly,
	the name still seems fitting, and I've retained it, with fresh iconography.
</p>
<p>
	A couple years ago I worked on pilot projects for two of the six class I railroads.
