<h1>Echo Transit</h1>
<p>
	Elegant, usable, accessible interface to transit spacetime.
</p>
<h3>
	Motivation
</h3>
<p>
	Private automobiles overtook public transit because they offered a better UX.
	Bertha Benz captured the world's imagination with the first roadtrip, in 1888.
	Henry Ford made them accessible and affordable after the first tribulation.
	Alfred Sloan, father of planned obsolescence, and his gaggle of <a href="http://wikipedia.org/en/Great_Streetcar_Conspiracy">convicted conspirators</a> swept away the street rails.
	By the end of the 20th century, America had become a parking lot.
</p>
<p>
	Now this millennial generation is shedding the yoke of the automobile.
	Humanless carriages are a reality.
	"Ride sharing" is all the rage.
	Rail ridership is up.
	Horse-drawn buggies are returning.
	And wealth is pouring back into downtowns.
	The kids don't wanna spin the wheels of their gas guzzlah like their boomer grandpop,
	living out in a suburban desert.
	Why by 9 kilodollars a year for that isolation pod, that road rage inducer.
	<a href="">X's '1x interview with pmarca</a> reminded me of <a href="">Playboy talking with Steve Job in '84</a>.
	The "sharing economy" might be more "unloading tiresome burdens".
	Automobiles, <a href="">the greatest killer of young people in the U.S.</a>, have become more restraining than liberating; a hassel, a bore -- Dead Ends and Do Not Enters and traffic cops.
	<a href="">Tire malls and... (Roger Rabbit.)</a>
	A smartphone means taking that <a href="">trail</a> in the night,
	because you have a flash light and map and global position system.
	Smartphones now shine a brighter beacon of freedom.
	From Massachusetts to California, freeways are being replaced with greenways and walkways.
	In San Francisco, our millennial city of seven hills, the PCC streetcars feel contemporary, the busses outdated, the cable cars futuristic.
<p>
	Perhaps 2012 was the curve point of the track of history; we're ahead of, but alongside, our evolution -- able to decide our culture instead of accepting it unconsciously.
	The fish don't realize they're in water, but the dolphins -- once deerlike creatures -- certainly do.
	We're climbing back into passenger transport, like the cephalopods did the sea,
	and Echo Transit looks to seize the opportunity to improve the experience,
	to make riding the bus easier and faster than hailing, whether by hand or screen, a cab (or proprietary-ride-share).

	Content
</h3>
<p>
	The initial map and schedule are for the bus route between Bangor to Old Town, Maine,
	which closely follows the first passenger rail line in the U.S. 
	In 1835... TODO
</p>
<p>
	In 1914, one could ride an electric street railcar from Bangor to Old Town after midnight.
	Today the bus doesn't run past 19:00.
</p>
<h3>
	Construction
</h3>
<p>
	Currently a static mockup in HTML and CSS only.
	This is to focus on getting the design right before adding any code,
	but also building with the actual materials (instead of, say, Adobe products).
	A scale model, if you will, as opposed to blueprints.
</p>
<p>
	Earlier attempts consisted of templates and DOM assembly and quickly veered off course,
	as implementation concerns ground the design process to a halt.
	Technical debt amassed, as if racking up a list of renovations while laying the foundation.
	Creating software seems more akin to producing a teleseries or image strip than a building:
	thus this approach fits in line with first writing the teleplay, doing the pencils.
	This is the script, the pencil drawing, to be acted out and recorded, inked and colored.
</p>
<p>
	More accurately, software resembles a lifeform.
	We are, after all, made of code.
	We're more operating system than computer.
	(But our codebase is smaller.)
	To grow a mammal, you can't put up the bones, then fill in the meat, and finally slap some skin over it all.
	With life, breaking the build deletes the instance (and that's where copies of the repo are kept).
</p>
<p>
	This is static for now, because it's still in fetal form.
</p>
<h3>
	Design
</h3>
<p>
	The idea is to get the route interface right first.
	Comparatively little attention has been given to the selection of routes,
	and virtually none to country,
	subdivision (i.e. state/province/territory),
	or subsubdivision (i.e. county/parrish/municipality).
